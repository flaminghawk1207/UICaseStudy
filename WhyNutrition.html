                    A dictionary meaning of Health indicates “a state of being free from illness”. Often the challenge 
                    is to keep in that state for longer period of time. Many of the comorbidities are acquired through 
                    lifestyle, type of work/work environment, and other environmental exposure. It is important to 
                    identify these factors that could adversely impact the person’s health to keep in this state 
                    for long run.

                    Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining food for necessary for health and growth. 
                    Nutritional plans are sustainable, flexible and for varied reasons, not necessary just for weight 
                    loss or gain, and primarily for overall nourishment.

                    Food or drink that we consume on a regular basis is considered as Diet. Diet is part of 
                    Nutrition, which is a specific kind and amount of food are recommended for a medical condition
                    or specific reason for e.g. weight loss. Diet plans are normally short term, fixed 
                    (non-flexible), and difficult to adhere to.

                <p>
                    &nbsp Often people are conscious of nutrition and diet reactively in response to an event.<br><br> 
                    Imagine you own a car, how do you want to maintain your car? You maintain it very well, right fuel, 
                    right level of coolant always, right tire pressure. What happens if you don’t have right level 
                    of coolant / tire pressure, the car won’t stop then and there, but affects the life of the engine 
                    or tires.<br><br> 
                    A body is a complex god given gift. We don’t realize the worth of the part, until we are dependent 
                    on external intervention. You breathe oxygen day in and day out, imagine a day to be on external 
                    oxygen. Money we spent in hospitalization, cost of oxygen/equipment on an ongoing basis… for a 
                    lifetime! Certainly we owe a lot the creation.<br><br>   
                    For a car, where we have an option to sell or buy a new one, we give so much of importance 
                    to KNOW-IT-ALL about the car,  maintain it well, and focus to upkeep of performance, 
                    proactive / periodic monitoring of working condition.<br><br> 
                    How much time do we have to take care of our own health? How much we know about our body,
                    needs, what we feed, impact in short term and long term?<br><br>
                    Then the standard excuses..<br><br>
                    “Nutrition is always complex, I can’t learn”<br><br>
                    “Biology is difficult subject, I did not study”<br><br>
                    “Healthy items are not tasty”<br><br>
                    “There are conflicting advices from different sources, can’t understand what is right”<br><br>
                    “It is difficult to sustain/follow for long term”<br><br>
                    Do we have these excuses while maintain the car? Are these real excuses? Are these worth 
                    knowing for the return on effort, your own health?<br><br>
                    An effort is made here to simplify learning about Nutrition and essentials in simple terms,
                    helps you to understand the present status, and have a target, and what changes are required 
                    in your life style to meet your personal goals.
